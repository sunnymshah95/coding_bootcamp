This is my "Coding Bootcamp" project, where I try to self-learn algorithms and data structures in C++ (extending them to Python is pretty straight-forward, hence the use of C++). I follow the textbook *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen et al. I try to answer some of the questions and write my own programs, based on the pseudocodes provided in the textbook or the descriptions given in the questions at the end of the chapter.

### About me:
I'm a MS student at Stanford University, studying Computational and Mathematical Engineering within the [Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu/). My concentration is __Mathematical and Computational Finance__. I've already taken several classes on Python and C++ (CME 211 + 212).
